# Lab 4: Licensing

### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
It is important to choose a license because of the permissions it provides to everyone. A project is only officially open source if it has a license. A license gives anyone who is interested permission to use and distribute your code without fear of copyright claims. 

### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
A project without an explicit license could mean the author does not grant anyone permission to use or modify their code. In this case, using the project anyway could get you into trouble with copyright infringement if you chose to redistribute it. Additionally, your own work would belong to you alone meaning that no one else could use or modify your contributions to the project. This would make things messy as different contributors own different sections of the project as a whole. 

### Why the Web beat Gopher


### Android and Apache
Android chooses to use Apache for its userspace license. This is because they want to promote as much third-party development as possible. These projects and their communities would be perfect for creating opportunities for proprietary redistribution. https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/11/why-google-chose-the-apache-software-license-over-gplv2/
Additionally, Google wants to benefit from the contributions made to open source without having to reveal their own proprietary code. Ultimately, Google strives for both fast development and proprietary value so it uses Apache like many other companies do.
