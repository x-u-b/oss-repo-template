# Part 2: Reading Questions
How to answer questions in a helpful way:
 1) Try to generalize the question/answer. This way the bigger picture allows us to apply this solution to a broader set of problems. Many questions may have similar but nuanced problems that can all be solved when the root cause is understood.

 2) Gather as much info about the problem as possible before answering. Oftentimes a single question is not enough to understand the end goal of the asker. The reason that they asked the question in the first place might even indicate that their entire approach is wrong. 

Free Culture:

  Just like the internet, open source software is a relatively new concept and was certainly understood even less back in 2002. The introduction of the internet posed a huge threat to many companies who suddenly discovered the act of piracy. Thus, when Jesse unintentionally facilitated the piracy of music with his search engine, the RIAA was quick to shut down his program in a way that he would never try something like this again. With the power of an entire industry, they easily crushed Jesse with lawsuits and put a stop to his work. In reality, his work on the search engine was in no way meant to harm anyone. The unfortunate truth is that the internet is such a versatile and easily accessed tool to share information that big corporations would do anything to slow down its expansion in order to preserve their business. The risk of using/modifying open source software is evident through Jesse's actions. Problems like this have improved over the years but as the internet grows more powerful, things get more complicated.
